# Predicting-Depression
My final project for a Statistics class at UW-Madison. The data is sourced from the Dane County Youth Assessment, a survey given to high schoolers in Dane County, Wisconsin. In this project, we write a formal report that contains different predictive and analytical measures of the data, including logistic regression, a categorical PCA, K-Means clustering, classification trees, loss assessment, and a random forest. Our aim with this project was to identify the most influential variables of home and community life on diagnosed depression. We identified that self-care and parental mental health factored greatly into our ability to predict our outcome variable.
