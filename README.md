# Predicting-Depression
My final project for a Statistics class at UW-Madison. The data is sourced from the Dane County Youth Assessment, a survey given to high schoolers in Dane County, Wisconsin. In this project, we write a formal report that contains different predictive and analytical measures of the data, including logistic regression, a categorical PCA, K-Means clustering, classification trees, loss assessment, and a random forest.
